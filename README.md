An Angular 15 CRUD example App to consume Rest APIs, display, modify data.

# Why this
This angular project will be used as frontend application. It will consume rest api which will be provided by a spring-boot application. Initially both of them will be running in local development pc. Final goal is to deploy both of those in docker and run from there.  

# What this angular application does:
- Each employee has id, name, age.
- We can create, retrieve, update, delete employee.

# Pre-requisite
- Knowledge on angular
  - Initiate project
  - Basics of angular i.e. component, service, routing
  - Send rest call and receive/consume response
  - Build for production
    
- Basic Docker commands

Run `ng serve --port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
